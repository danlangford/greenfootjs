greenfootjs
===========

maybe someday a js/web clone or port of [Greenfoot development environment](http://www.greenfoot.org)

goals/plans/ideas/random thoughts:
* use [ACE](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) editor for code
* deploy on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/)
* built almost entirely on [Cloud9](http://c9.io)
* allow ANY user to code and share apps
* Leverage Google account for users to save work.
    - maybe even leverage google apis for storing their work on [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com)
